# Space Quest League Technical Achievement Challenges with Trino

Welcome to the [Trino](https://trino.io/) getting started tutorial repository -
*Space Quest League* edition!

Back by popular demand, our Technical Achievement Challenges are returning in
Mission 3! Answer our SQL based questions each week, and win an e-gift card AND
increase your chances at the 30K prize! This time we have created three
Technical Achievement Challenge Sprints. Each sprint lasts one week and contains
two SQL questions that build upon one another.

**Sprint 1: 7/19-7/22**

**Sprint 2: 7/26-7/29**

**Sprint 3: 8/2-8/5**

Challenges will close at 5pm EST each Friday!

Based on @bitsondatadev's legendary [Trino Getting Started
Repo](https://github.com/bitsondatadev/trino-getting-started), this is a home
for a pre-configured [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
environment that is used to get new and existing users started on all the
different containers we have, and more importantly learn and have fun with
Trino.

All the information for Mission 3 is contained within the `mysql` folder, so if
you have docker installed, pop in there and we can get started.

If you want to learn more about Trino, I highly suggest giving a visit to the
Trino Getting Started Repo, where you can explore more capabilities outside what
we will utilize during these challenges. If you have questions about any of
these challenges, feel free to ping **Monica Miller** on the [Trino
Slack](https://trino.io/slack.html), and I will be happy to answer them!

## Prerequisites

In order to use this repository you need to have
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) installed to run your service
[containers](https://www.docker.com/why-docker). Check if you have Docker
installed by running `docker --version`. If Docker isn't found, please refer to
the [install insructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install
Docker before trying to run these tutorials. If you're on mac or windows, you
will just need to install docker desktop. If you're on a linux distribution, you
will just need to install the docker engine.
