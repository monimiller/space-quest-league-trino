# space-quest-league-trino


Welcome to the Trino getting started tutorial repository - Space Quest League edition!

We challenge you to the Mission 3 Space Quest League Technical Achievement Challenge Sprints, where for three weeks we will dive into some SQL challenges that can be completed using this repository! Completing these challenges will result in fun prizes, as well as bragging rights if you manage to successfully complete the entire series!

Based on @bitsondatadev's legendary Trino Getting Started Repo, this is a home for a set of pre-configured Docker Compose environments that are used to set up simple environments and showcase basic configurations in isolation to get new and existing users started on all the different containers we have, and more importantly learn and have fun with Trino.

Trino is a distributed SQL query engine designed to query large data sets distributed over one or more heterogeneous data sources. If you want to learn more about Trino, I highly suggest giving a visit to the Trino Getting Started Repo, where you can explore more capabilities outside what we will utilize during these challenges. If you have questions about any of these challenges, feel free to ping Monica Miller on the Trino Slack, and I will be happy to answer them!

Prerequisites
In order to use this repository you need to have Docker installed to run your service containers. Check if you have Docker installed by running docker --version. If Docker isn't found, please refer to the install insructions and install Docker before trying to run these tutorials. If you're on mac or windows, you will just need to install docker desktop. If you're on a linux distribution, you will just need to install the docker engine.

Getting Started
The challenges will be available on the [Space Quest League website](https://www.starburst.io/sweepstakes/). Refer to the Mission 3 Readme for setup instructions. More information about the program is available on the Space Quest League Website where I also have video demos on how to solve these challenges using either Starburst Galaxy or Trino.
